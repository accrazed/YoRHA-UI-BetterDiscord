## FAQ

### How to get the dark theme?

Check out my [discord support server](https://discord.gg/X4nBPCa), and check out #info for sources to dark/light theme :)

### Discord is running slower on your theme! CPU usage is high! Can I do anything to fix that?

I'm still not entirely sure what it is that causes the erroring, but it has to do with the animations in the theme, particularly the home icon.
Make sure to turn on hardware acceleration!

To turn off the home icon spin, you can add this to your override CSS on BetterDiscord:

```scss
.tutorialContainer-1pL9QS .svg-2zuE5p {
  animation-name: none !important;
}
```
